Solutions to the HackerRank 30 Days of code challenge in c++


## Getting Started Visual Studio Code macOS
On your first time running Visual Studio Code you will need to enable control of the terminl in order ot be able to debug c++ applications. Luckilly the configururation has already been added to this project, you just need to run a specific task. This is done by `Command + Shift + p` then `Tasks` and look for `Tasks: Run Tasks` then select or search for `Open Terminal`. This will cause macOS to ask you to confirm if you wish to allow Visual Studio Code to controll the terminal. You will need to click `OK` in order to debug with `stdin`

Also bin directories are not automaticlly created when cloning this git repo due to being empty. Luckilly there is a script for this too `Command + Shift + p` then `Tasks` and look for `Tasks: Run Tasks` then select or search for `Initialise bin directories`. This will create all bin subdirectories
